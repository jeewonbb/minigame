    <summary>How To Play</summary>
    <div class="description">
        <p>When the game starts, select your betting amount within the betting time.</p>
        <p>The bet will increase by the selected amount each time you click on the betting area.</p>
        <p>At the end of the betting time, make sure to confirm your bet by pressing the '<b>Confirm Bet</b>' button.
        </p>
        <p>Once a bet is confirmed, it cannot be canceled.</p>
        <p>The bets are as follows: </p>
        <figure class="column">
            <img src="./assets/images/manual-card.png" height="auto" />
            <figcaption>• 8, 9, 10, 11: The number of each bet is the base points.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>When the betting ends, you are dealt cards starting at 8.</p>
        <p>The Top card wins, which is the highest sum of the numbers on each bet and the numbers on the cards dealt.
            <br />(Example: Betting 8 + card 6♠ = 14 points)
        </p>
        <p>If there is more than one Top card, only those players receive one additional card to determine the winner.
            If the Top Card remains the same after the reopening, those players' bets will be returned.</p>
        <p>The game results can be seen on the live screen and in the round results.</p>
        <p>Winnings are automatically calculated and displayed in your Bet History.</p>
        <p>Betting on the next round starts immediately after the current round ends.</p>
